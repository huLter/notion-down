# Notion Down

![](https://circleci.com/gh/kaedea/notion-down.svg?style=shield&circle-token=9f4dc656e94d8deccd362e52400c96e709c7e8b3)

[Notion Down](https://github.com/kaedea/notion-down), python tools that convert Notion blog pages into Markdown files, along with intergation to build static webpages such as Hexo.  It's inspiration and goal is to __avoid separation  of writting__ by keep writting drafts or posts within [notion.so](http://notion.so) and then publish them into MD webpages automatically. 



## Features

What can notion-down do now:

 - Notion pages to basic MarkDown files
     - ~~Notion images downloading~~
     - ~~Notion nested list blocks~~
     - ~~Notion obfuscated-links parsing~~
     - ~~Notion table block (Collection)~~
 - Advanced Notion pageblocks support (WIP)
     - ~~Pullquote Blocks~~
     - Notion page embed blocks
 - Writting optimized integeration (WIP)
     - ~~Noton custom `ShortCode` blocks that control parametered MD files generating~~
     - ~~Mixed CN-EN text separation format [~~~~[by pangu](https://github.com/vinta/pangu)~~~~]~~
 - Hexo Integration (WIP)
     - ~~Hexo page properties config~~
     - Hexo generate
     - Hexo tags

## Hot It Works

NotionDown read Notion pages data using [notion-py](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py), and then write pages into MD files.

Basic usage:

> notion-down >> notion-py >> Notion pages data >> generating MD files

Advanced usage:

> WebHook >> notion-down >> notion-py >> Notion pages data >> generating MD files >> Copy into Hexo source >> generating webpages >> push to GitHub pages

## Getting Started

Set `notion_token_v2` at System ENV or `config.py` first, and then check the following procedures.

### UnitTest Examples

See unitest cases at `/test`.

### CI Build Script
